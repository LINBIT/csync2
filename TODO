Universal peace and a good attitude for everyone.

Check for mysql/mysql.h to exist in configure.
	Done

DB abstraction: check for installed databases on configure
	and enable/disable them for compilation.

Create MySQL database if it doesn't exist.

Implement table creation with schema support.
	We don't have a schema table yet, add it when it is needed.

Have check return value for asprintf () .. have a macro that does a csync_fatal 
	if there is no memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test schema support for SQLite 2.

Have command to pipe connection through (for SSH support for example)

Make database configurable.

From Gerhard Rieger:
	If there are more than one node to sync with print nodes that are not reachable.

	Segfault when syncing a file where one side is a directory and the other one
		is a link.
