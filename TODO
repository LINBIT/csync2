Better security concept:
- Allow using direct links using host-mappings
- Load shared secrets from extra files
- Create key files with "csync2 -k"

Eventually improve config file format.
Add SQL transactions to avoid races.
Optimize repeated checks in daemon code.
Add compare-mode to check if hosts are in sync.
