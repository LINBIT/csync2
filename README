About csync2
============

Csync2 is a cluster synchronization tool. It can be used to keep files on
multiple hosts in a cluster in sync. Csync2 can handle complex setups with
much more than just 2 hosts, handle file deletions and can detect conflicts.

It is expedient for HA-clusters, HPC-clusters, COWs and server farms. If
you are looking for a tool to sync your laptop with your workstation, you
better have a look at Unison (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/)
too.

See http://oss.linbit.com/ for more information on csync2. The csync2
git tree can be found at http://git.linbit.com/csync2.git/.
