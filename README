Installing csync2
=================

Requirements:

	- A linux system (or more/less compatible os)
	- The librsync package (incl. dev headers, at least version 0.9.5)
	- The sqlite package (incl. dev headers, at least version 2.8.13)

Build and install the binaries using:

	make install

Add the csync2 port to your /etc/services file:

	csync2	30865/tcp

Add csync2 to your /etc/inetd.conf file:

	csync2 stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/csync2 csync2 -i

Create your /etc/csync2.cfg and restart inetd.


csync2.cfg syntax
=================

The config file contains the definitions for all the syncronisation
groups in the cluster:

group
{
	host host1 host2 host3;
	key Yushaidi6nohnooviagheexahyasai;
	include /home/bob;
	exclude /home/bob/temp;
	exclude *~ .*;
}

The host statement adds the hosts. Note that the names used here must
equal to the output of "hostname" and all the musts must be reachable
using that names.

The key statement must be used exactly once in each group and defines
the shared secret for that host. Use something such as the output
of "pwgen 30 1" here.

The include and exclude pattern are a bit more complex. There are two
kind of patterns: pathname-patterns starting with a slash character and
basename patterns which do not.

The last matching pattern for each of both categories is choosen. If
both categories match, the file will be synchonized.


The database backend
====================

Sometimes it is neccessary to connect to the database backend; e.g. if
you changed your config and want to flush now obsolate entries from the
backend database. You need the sqlite command-line tool to open the
database:

	# sqlite /var/lib/csync2/$HOSTNAME.db

This opens up an SQL shell where you can access the database using
standard SQL queries.
