"Csync2 for Win32 (cygwin)" is based on the free software libraries Librsync,
SQLite, SQLite.NET wrapper, OpenSSL and Cygwin.


Setup:
======

1. Extract the contents of this .ZIP archive to c:\csync2.

2. Create a c:\tmp directory.

3. Create a c:\csync2\csync2.cfg (or copy it from existing nodes).

4. Add entries to c:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts (optional).

5. Run c:\csync2\monitor.exe in a command window.

Pass the directory names which should be monitored by the hint deamon(s) as
parameters to "monitor.exe".

Read the csync2 documentation (bundled with the csync2 source tar) for more
information about writing csync2 configuration files.


Additional Tools
================

Some basic programs from the cygwin toolchain which might be of great help for
bootstrapping large csync2 setups (such as a unix-like 'cp' programm) are also
included in this "Csync2 for Win32 (cygwin)" binary distribution.

An SQLite command line shell is included as well. This is especially useful
for administratice tasks such as running the SQL VACUUM command.
